### Files for Exploration

* The "Exploration.ipynb" notebook was the exploration done with the MAG data.
* The "supplemental_test_data_SPARK.ipynb" notebook is a PySpark/Databricks notebook that was used to pull supplemental data for each paper in the test set.
* "L1_Filler_Exact.ipynb" is a notebook which gets the data to try a technique to use the L0 and L2 predictions for a paper and gives the most likely L1 (if missing). This technique was unsuccessful in the current implementation but it may be revisited at a later date.
